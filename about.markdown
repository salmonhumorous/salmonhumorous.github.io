<font size="5">
I am a generative artist and creative coder interested in the intersection of art, technology, and design.
The endless potential of computational systems serves as an inspiration for my work. I utilise algorithms to create artworks that change over time or in response to variables.

<br>
I'm attempting to learn more about the creative uses of technology and design methodologies. Please get in touch with me if you have any inquiries or would want to collaborate together.
